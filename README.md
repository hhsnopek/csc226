CSC226 - Data Structures w/Java
===

A repo for my course assignments & projects.

# Why is there Go inside a Java Course?!
Well Java is a bit dull to me, so I asked to use Go on my assignments rather than Java!

# What's with all the comments in the Go code?!! IT'S SO MESSY!
The comments within the Go code are there for my professors needs :)
